			<p class="section-content">Dorylus Travel Adventures (DTA) is a conservation-inspired travel agency that
				offers curated experiences that showcase the best of Rwanda and the East Africa region. Our aim is to
				provide inspiring travel experiences that leave a positive impact on both the traveler and the
				destinations we explore.</p>
			<h1 class="display-4">Our Story</h1>

			<p class="section-content">The life
				-
				changing presentation in October 2023 about ants made
				the founder
				realize the importance
				of protecting these fascinating creatures. Conservation efforts for ants should begin b
				y gaining a
				comprehensive understanding of all species through research. Based on empirical evidence,
				conservation initiatives can then be implemented.
				When
				the founder
				inquired about the presenter's future plans, they turned the question around and
				asked
				about
				his
				. Given
				the
				limited scientific background for initiating research projects,
				the founder
				reflected on
				his
				own experiences and came up with the idea of opening a travel agency. Drawing
				from
				over
				10 years of experience in the travel industry,
				they
				aim ed
				to combine the passion for conservation practices with the creation of this agency.
				The agency's name, Dorylus Travel Adventures, was inspired by the popular driver ants, also known
				as siafu or safari ants. DTA's goal is to organize trips to Rwanda and
				the surrounding region.Part of the net revenue generated from these travels will be dedicated to
				supporting ant research..</p>

			<h1 class="display-4">Our being & our doing</h1>
			<p class="section-content">We believe that travel can be a genuine force for good. That’s why we’
				re committed to enrich lives through
				inspiring travel experiences that leave a positive impact on both the traveler and the
				destinations we explore.
				We are committed to supporting the study of the ants through building local knowledge and
				understanding of ant biodiversity in Rwanda and the region.
				It is believed that Rwanda harbors more than 600 species with only 147 species taxonomy
				discovered so far. The taxonomy of the other 453 species is unknown. We are dedicated to creating
				unique and immersive journeys that contribute to the scientifi
				c research of the ant biodiversity in
				Rwanda and the region. Through our expertly curated itineraries, we aim to ignite a passion for
				understanding and conserving the vital role ants play in our ecosystem.
				With a commitment to sustainability and responsibl
				e travel, we strive to showcase the wonders of
				nature fostering a sense of awe and respect for wildlife and more particularly the ant kingdom; tiny
				yet remarkable creatures.</p>
